# Horiseon Refactoring
This project is to make the web pages more accessible to the user. In order to achieve this several changes have been made which are listed below:

## Navigation Header
The navigation header contains the main heading and navigation links which point to the three main sections of the document. The navigation headings were moved to the right of the main heading and spaced out for better visibility.

## Semantics HTML Tags
Most of the non-semantic tags in the html page were replaced by semantic tags to make the document more readable. 

## CSS Consolidation
Following the semantic tag changes in the html document, the corresponding changes were made in the styling file. The CSS selectors were consolidated without compromising the page styling. This makes the code more readable and easier to manage and easier to modify.

## Comments
Both the CSS and html pages were extensively commented to improve readability.
